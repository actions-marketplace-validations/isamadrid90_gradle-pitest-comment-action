</p>


This is a POC to make it easier to include mutation testing as a part of a regular pipeline,
it has a lot of room to improvement

What it does ‚ùì
============

The purpose of this action is to execute pitest, upload the report as an artifact and
add a comment with the summary of the execution

Prerequisites üìù
============

* Gradle
* PITest plugin

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("info.solidsoft.pitest") version "1.7.0"
}
```

* PITest configuration working in local, here an example:

```kotlin
pitest {
    setProperty("junit5PluginVersion", "0.12")
    setProperty("targetClasses", listOf("package-to-check"))
    setProperty("outputFormats", listOf("HTML")) //this is important because it will update it as an artifact
}
```

How to use it üõ†Ô∏è
=============
